# Interactive Text Tracker with Visual Feedback

This repository features a robust and interactive Character Counter application designed to elevate the user experience while typing in a textarea. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app provides real-time feedback on the number of characters entered, including the total count and the remaining characters allowed, with a configurable limit (default set to 150 characters).

Going beyond basic functionality, this project categorizes input into letters, digits, and special characters, offering users detailed insights into their typing patterns. The dynamic visual feedback system enhances usability by changing the color of the remaining character count, signaling whether the user is within the limit or has exceeded it.

Designed with a modern, responsive layout, the application ensures seamless performance across all devices, from desktops to smartphones. With smooth animations and a clean interface, this project is perfect for developers seeking to implement advanced text input features in their web applications. Whether for form validation or enhancing input interactions, this character counter serves as a polished and practical solution.
